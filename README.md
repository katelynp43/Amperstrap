# README
The Amperstrap Site Repo!

### What is this repository for?
* The site is built as a starter framework to which all GSF sites are built.

### How do I even?
This assumes you have Node, Bower, RVM, SASS and Compass already installed.

#### If you do not that these installed, set up the following:
* Install [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
* Open a terminal window.
    * `$ brew install git`
* Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
    * `$ brew install node`
* Install [Bower](http://bower.io/)
    * `$ npm install -g bower`
* Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
    * `$ npm install -g gulp`

#### If you do already have them installed, then do this:
* Pull this directory down.
* From a new terminal window within this project, type: ``` npm install ```
* Then type: ``` bower install ```
* Then type: ``` gulp ```
* A browser window should open with the site showing.

### Gulp Commands (Quicklist)
* ``` gulp ``` - starts server and kicks off watching.

### Contribution guidelines
* Submit code on your own branch. Make a pull request.
